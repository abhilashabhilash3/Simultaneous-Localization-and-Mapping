# Simultaneous Localization and Mapping 

SLAM-Simultaneous localization and area mapping is a method used by autonomous vehicles and mobile robots to map an unknown area or update a map of a known environment successfully while at the same time keeping track of its current location in the map generated.

Current work deals with making it cost effective to implement, creating an easily understandable and readable map, at the same time keeping the number of movements of the mobile robot minimal.
